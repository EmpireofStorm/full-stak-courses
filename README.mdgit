Hi there, this is the first time I am upgrading this file and i really dont know what to say about this project.
First of all i almost complete Full stack development course by IBM at Coursera.org so check them out, it is actually a pretty cool course with a lot of different videos explaining everything you pretty much need, maybe except API like react, jshint, etc.
